Fixtures are used for backup

Below is some command and its explanation is as follow.
One can be specific on the data that one wants to extract from the app
    For example below  the app_name has been specified
    python manage.py app_name dumpdata --format json --indent 4 > app-name/fixtures/filen_name.json

    This second example the app_name has not beenn specified
    The greater than sign shows that after generating the data we write it into a json file
    python manage.py dumpdata --format json --indent 4 > app-name/fixtures/filen_name.json

2. Reload the data back

    pythonn  mange.py loaddata app_name/fixtures/file_name.json
